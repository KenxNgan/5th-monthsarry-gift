<h1><span style=>&#128525;</span><span style=>&#128536;</span>Our Wonderful Love Story<span style=>&#128525;</span><span style=>&#128536;</span></h1>
This is my very first website and <b> I dedicate this to my girlfriend </b> Happy 5th monthsarry baby, I hope you're gonna love this gift I made for you. I love you so much my baby Ngan
<h2> Boring Introduction </h2>
<p>
I decided to make a website since the keychain I made (my first gift idea) is still not yet done even though I went to the shop 2 days in advance,
it would be a shame for me if I couldn't give you a gift on this special day. So I squeezed my hamster brain and I remember I watched a horror documentary
 on YouTube about a man who committed suicide and made a website to state why he committed suicide. And I took that idea (fucking weird idea ngl) 
 to make a website, I squeeze my brain with a lemon squeezer this time to recollect my memories and knowledge from my Grade 7 ICT class which 
 I learned different things like using Microsoft Office in a professional way, Basics in Photoshop editing, and ofc this one creating a simple HTML5 website.
 I'm not a super nerdy genius tho and remember all of those grade 7 memories so I asked assistance online and to my Junior High friends studying in 
 Computer related courses.

 <br> <b>Dump</b> is a trend where people makes a video that contains digital pictures/clips of videos that was captured during that month (November) and post/story
 it on social media. But since I'm not good at editing and making Video presentation, I'm using this website to create a dump.

<h1> How do we start? </h1>
We met each other on snapchat, I'm randomly adding people on snapchat and she accepted my friend request on June 6 2023.
 We keep talking and talking that day, sharing her pics and messages updating my life to her until eventually one day I asked for her social media account
to know more about her and she gave it. We started to follow each other on Instagram and became friends on Facebook, I easily fell for her sweet talks and actions.
Everyday, she's concerned about me, like I'm someone special, she's always worried about me and taking care of me wishing me the best. She's such a sweet and wonderful girl,
and the more we talk the more I learn about her. She's so hardworking and intelligent girl and loving girl, she loves football. She always study and she loves Chemistry and Physics,
which is the opposite of me because I only study these subjects when necessary like entrance exams or something. She work so hard everyday for her future and to make her family proud,
she's the girl that I want to marry and spend the rest of my life with. One day, everything is usual and okay until suddenly she opened up with me and feels sad,
I comfort her as best I could but she keep saying bad things to herself, I got paranoid and worried and I suddenly say "but I love you" and starting from that day 24th of June we became couples.
